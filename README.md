ENTER THE TEMPLE

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

welcome to our game! The name of our game is called "Enter the temple" its a game based on the adventure that the user picks. Here the user will be able to choose multiple options and play the game according to how the user picks the adventure. The user that wil choose the correct adventure will be able to win the game. The application was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The challanges we faced during coding this application mainly icluded the room entries, some buttons not functioning how we wanted them to and mostly the trap room that we have set up in our game, in the trap room we had to diplay the riddle API that we used. so we had to spend some time to debug and get them working which we did. But other than that we were pair programming and we finally were able to get it done!

HOW TO USE

TO use the game, the user can start the adventure button which will start the game and from there scroll down to the option to enter the game, if so the USER will be prompted to an option of the room they want their adventure to begin from. Each room has an option that can either take the USER to the next room which is the safe room in which the USER gets asked another question , the trap room in which the USER gets asked a riddle and if they get the riddle right they get to the safe room and continue to choose the next adventure and will be a step closer to victory.
